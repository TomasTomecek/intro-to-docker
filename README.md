# Practical introdcution to containers

This is an introductory workshop to Docker. It is meant to be suited for everyone: from beginners to intermediate users.


## Motivation

We've just found this new messaging app â€” [Rocket.chat](https://rocket.chat/) ([demo](https://demo.rocket.chat/home)) and we want to run it on our server.

Let's see how would [the manual installation](https://rocket.chat/docs/installation/manual-installation/centos) look like.

---

That's pretty complicated, is there an easier way?

We can run rocket.chat just by executing these two commands:

```
$ sudo docker run \
  --name=mongo \
  --net=host \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  mongo:3.4

$ sudo docker run \
  --name=rocket \
  --net=host \
  -e MONGO_URL=mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017 \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  rocket.chat
```

Rocket.chat is now running inside docker containers and we can check it out:

```
$ xdg-open http://localhost:3000
```


## Setting up docker locally

CentOS users are advised to use `yum` package manager, Fedora users should run
`dnf`. Users of other linux distributions and operating systems are on their
own.

So let's install docker:

```
$ sudo yum install docker
```

And let's start it:

```
$ sudo systemctl start docker
```

Is it running?

```
$ systemctl status docker
```

Is it really running?

```
$ sudo docker version
```


## Tell me more about docker

Docker is a platform to manage complete lifecycle of applications including
building, packaging, running, distributing, deploying, scaling. Docker uses
linux containers for running applications and its own format to distribute the
application images.

Docker tool is using client & server architecture:

### Containers

Containers are made of a writable layer on top of an image. Once you start a
container, it's also a traditional linux process.

Let's create a container:

```
$ sudo docker create -ti --name=toy fedora:25 bash
```

Is it running?

```
$ sudo docker inspect toy
```

```
$ sudo docker start toy
```

```
$ sudo docker attach toy
```

Let's change something!

```
$ echo "Just testing." >/fun
```

What about the writable layer thingy?

```
$ sudo docker diff toy
```


### Okay, so how do I...

#### ...store data persistently? How do I run a database inside a container?

```
$ sudo docker start mongo
$ sudo docker inspect mongo | grep Mounts
```

```
$ sudo docker run -d --name=other-mongo \
                  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
                  -v $PWD/mongo-data:/data/db mongo:3.4
```

Ehm, can we have some output please?

```
$ sudo docker logs other-mongo
```

I meant what's going on right now!

```
$ sudo docker logs -f other-mongo
```


#### ...run a web service?

```
$ sudo docker run -dit --name our-httpd -v "$PWD":/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4
```

I want to access the web server from internet.

```
$ sudo docker rm our-httpd

$ sudo docker run -dit -p 8000:80 --name our-httpd -v "$PWD":/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4
```


#### ...get rid of sudo? And why are you using it?

The answer:

```
$ export docker="sudo docker"
$ export d="sudo docker"
```

The other answer:

```
$ ls -lha /run/docker.sock

$ sudo docker run -ti -v /:/hostfs registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:26 bash
```


## Let's explore

We can start our journey by launching a shell prompt inside a container. Let's have a closer look at the rocket.chat container:

```
$ sudo docker exec -ti rocket bash

$ cat /etc/os-release
$ ps aux
```

Let's go back to host.

How does the container look?

```
$ htop
```

What are the technologies containers are using?

```
$ sudo docker run -ti --rm registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:26 bash

$ dnf install -y procps-ng iproute

$ ls -lha /proc/self/ns/
$ mount
$ ps aux
$ hostname
$ ip a
```


### Images

Container images are a method to distribute applications. They are being built
using docker, then uploaded to docker registries so they can be distrbuted.

Here's [the rocket.chat image](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/rocket.chat/) inside
Docker Hub, the registry provided by Docker Inc.

Images are composed of metadata and layered filesystem trees. These filesystem
trees contain your service or application plus all its dependencies.

Huh, what?

Okay, let's take it step by step.

First we need to download the image from the registry, that's what we already
did when we ran the rocket.chat container.

Let's inspect the filesystem tree now:

```
$ sudo docker create --name image-content rocket.chat /bin/false && \
  mkdir -p ./image && \
  sudo docker export image-content | tar -x -C ./image

$ ls -lha ./image
```

But you said layered!

![Layers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/images/container-layers.jpg)

Source: https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/

```
$ mkdir -p layered-image && \
  sudo docker save rocket.chat | tar -x -C ./layered-image
$ mc ./layered-image
```

I hope it's clear that images are not containers.
